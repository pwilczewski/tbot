# Training personalized chatbots
This repo contains my code for building personalized chatbots. My methodology provides a lightweight way for individuals to customize chatbots that learn about them and can respond to users on their behalf. My personalized Telegram bot is available here: https://t.me/batbetbitbotbut_bot

I describe my approach in greater detail here https://indiequant.substack.com/p/training-personalized-chatbots
