# Training personalized chatbots
This repo contains my code for building personalized chatbots. My methodology is a low cost and low overhead approach for individuals to train customized chatbots that learn about them and can respond to others on their behalf. My personalized bot is available on [Telegram](https://t.me/batbetbitbotbut_bot). 

I describe my approach in greater detail on my [substack](https://indiequant.substack.com/p/training-personalized-chatbots).

If you're interested in training your own bot using my methodology and infrastructure, contact me.
